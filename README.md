# Lego Collection tracker using PERN development.

As a user,

I WANT a website where I can login with a username & password,
WHERE I can view my current lego set collection by theme or a list of total sets,
THEN I can select an individual set in my collection to view,
THEN be presented with information about the selected lego set,
INCLUDING the U.S retail price, current value, released date, retired date,
THEN I can add a lego set to my collection by searching by set number or theme id,
THEN I can choose to DELETE any set in my current collection.
